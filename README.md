# StudyApp
StudyApp is an Android app I am continuously developing to practice as many Android development concepts as possible. As of right now, the app lets users add and store flashcards as well as decks. The app has been adapted to different screen sizes. Recently, the UI has received an update in accordance with Material 3 Expressive. Details about the components covered and features planned can be found in the wiki and the open issues.
